Briefly, I am an avid geospatial scientist / engineer with backgrounds in software development, thermal & hyperspectral remote sensing and several other areas of geospatial tech. In the recent years, I have been working on using Python to teach math and science and at the intersection of statistics, data science and geospatial technologies.

In this personal website, you can find my past projects, cheatsheets I developed while learning something new and the articles and talks I have delivered.
