# Welcome to Atma's blog

I am a staff software engineer, specializing in backend development at [One Concern](https://oneconcern.com/en/), where I lead the development of spatial data pipelines and mapping APIs. Previously, I worked as a principal and lead product engineer for the ArcGIS API for Python at [Esri](https://www.esri.com) and before that as a remote sensing scientist at the [Indian Space Research Organization](https://www.isro.gov.in). I over 15 years of experience in private, academic, and government research institutions across different countries, applying various facets of geospatial technology. I went to school at College of Engineering, Anna University, India for my undergard, and University of Northern Iowa for my masters.

In this personal website, you can find some of my past projects, articles, talks and some teaching resources I developed.
