Title: 2024 Anna University Geo Innovation Challenge - Invited speaker series

## Talk: Disaster Resilience: Forecasting business interruptions in the face of climate change using meteorological big-data
**About the event**: The **GeoInnovation Challenge** at Anna University is a prestigious competition that promotes innovation in geospatial technologies to address critical ecosystem challenges and contribute to national sustainability goals. Organized by the [Institute of Remote Sensing at Anna University](https://irs.annauniv.edu/irs/) and supported by the [National Geospatial Program](https://dst.gov.in/national-geospatial-programme-erstwhile-nrdms) of the [Department of Science and Technology (DST)](https://dst.gov.in), the 2024 edition focuses on themes like climate resilience, precision agriculture, urban heat island management, and disaster management. Participants submit innovative proposals that can receive funding and support for further development. The challenge is open to students and professionals in geospatial sciences, and past editions have seen successful projects like "Drishti," which focused on forest fire detection and management.

I was invited as a speaker and to the panel of judges to evaluate and select the winning proposals.
