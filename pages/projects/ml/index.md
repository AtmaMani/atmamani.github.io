Title: Machine Learning Projects

Today, we teach machines to learn. Tomorrow, we hope they'd return the favor ;-)

## Getting started

 - [Understanding Scikit-Learn syntax](sklearn-1/)
 - [Linear regression with `sklearn` and `statmodels`](sklearn_statmodels_linear_regression/)
 - [Naive Bayes classification with `sklearn` - a work in progress](sklearn_naive_bayes_classifier/)


## ML at scale with PySpark

 - [Getting started with PySpark](pyspark/getting-started-pyspark/)
 - [CA housing price prediction with PySpark](pyspark/spark-ml-ca-housing/)
