    "### P-values\n",
    "The `p-value` of a coefficient is the probability of \n",
    " - $H_{0} \\ = \\ 0$ : Null hypothesis that coefficient is 0. That is, it has no effect on the model / phenomena\n",
    " - $\\alpha$ is the threshold you set to determine what is statistically significant. By convention it is `0.95` for `p-values`.\n",
    "Thus, those coefficents whose `p-value`s are less than $\\alpha$ have a significant coefficient. The size of the coefficient determines their influence on the model itself, not the `p-value`.\n",

    "When you simplify your model (step-wise forward or hierarchical), you start by removing those predictors whose `p-value` is greater than $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",

    "Regression coefficients represent the mean value by which the predicted variable will change for `1` unit change in that particular predictor variable while holding all other variables constant. Thus, regression provides a high level of explainability associated with each variable and its influence on the phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "### R-squared\n",
    "As said before, $R^{2}$ measures the variability of predicted data vs actual data with mean. It can be interpreted as proportion of variability in Y that can be explained using X. A regression with **high `p-value` and low $R^{2}$** is problematic. What this means is the trend (slope) is significant where as the data has a lot of inherent variability that the model does not explain well.\n",

    "\n",
    "### S\n",
    "The Std. Error in regression (also called as `RSE` (residual standard error)) quantifies how far the points are spread from the regression line. This also helps build the prediction interval and understand what the error would be on average when you predict unknown dataset.\n",

    "[Resource](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/how-to-identify-the-most-important-predictor-variables-in-regression-models) Follow the axioms below when you try to explain a regression analysis\n",
    " - do not use `p-value` to explain influence of a predictor. `p-value` only suggests the significance of the coefficient not being `0`\n",
    " - do not compare the importance of two predictors based on their coefficients (slopes). The variables might be in different units and hence may not be a fair comparison\n",
    " - To compare predictors, **standardize** them (subtract mean and divide by SD -> **transform to std. normal Z scores**)\n",
    " - Now compare the coefficients for influence.\n",
    " - When you add more variables to the model, the $R^{2}$ increases, but this does not mean the model improves. In this case, calculate the **adj.$R^{2}$** which accounts for this.\n",
    " - Another approach is, when you build the model step-wise, find the variable that accounts for greatest increase in $R^{2}$ value. That is the most influential predictor.\n",
    " - Another adavantage of standardization is it reduces **multicollinearity**"
