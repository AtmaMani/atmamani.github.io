    "The MSE obtained is called **training MSE**. When used against unseen test data, we get **test MSE**. Our objective is to choose the method with lowest *test MSE*. There is no guarantee that a low training MSE will yield a low test MSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental property in statistical learning is **as model flexibility increases, training MSE might decrease, but test MSE might not**. When a given learning method yields a **small training MSE** but a **large test MSE**, we are **overfitting** the data. This is because, our data might have noise from **irreducible error** and the model is trying to fit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias variance trade-off\n",
    "If you plot the **test MSE** against **model flexibility**, it follows a *U shaped curve*. Thus it first reduces then increases. The expected test MSE for observation $x_{0}$ $E(y_{0} - \\hat f(x_{0}))$ can be decomposed to `3` fundamental quantities: (a) the **variance of** $\\hat f(x_{0})$, (b) **the squared bias** of $\\hat f(x_{0})$ and (c) **variance of irreducible error** $\\epsilon$. Thus:\n",

    "Thus, to reduce the expected test MSE, we need to reduce both the **variance of $\\hat f$** and **bias of $\\hat f$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance** refers to the amount by which $\\hat f$ would change if we estimated it using a different training dataset. Ideally, $\\hat f$ should not change much if a slightly different data set is used. A statistical learning method with high variance would yield a very different $\\hat f$ for different training data sets. **Higher the model flexibility, the higher is its variance** as the model closely fits the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias** refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-life problem. Generally, **higher model flexibility, the lower is the bias**. Thus as we use more flexible methods, the variance will increase and bias would decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "As model **flexibility increases**, the **bias reduces faster** than the rate at which **variance increases**. Thus, the **test MSE** drops initially before increasing (`U shape`). This relationship is called the **bias variance trade-off** and the objective is to pick the model flexibility that has the least of both."
