Title: What is my wildfire hazard score?

The map below shows the wildfire hazard potential (or score) for any community. The layer is out of the Esri LivingAtlas of the world. If you would like to know more about this resource, read [this blog](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/analytics/wildfire-hazard-potential-demographics/) and this [story map](https://arcg.is/1WPDOG).

"A score of 5 is very high risk and a score between 0-1 is likely non-burnable area such as water or asphalt. People that live in areas of moderate to high risk are more likely to be affected by wildfire events including evacuations, higher home insurance, and bad air quality due to smoke."
