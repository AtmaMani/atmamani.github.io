For instance, take the list of gas stations in a city or restaurants in a city, revenue from medical industry, there is always some element of this data that can be categorized as being spatial - be it locations, routes the products take, cost variations in gas prices etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spatial relationship is of significant interest to me and I have been analyzing them for over a decade and have been building software to analyze them for more than half of the past decade. While majority of what I built were proprietary, this blog is a look at what is available in the open-source ecosystem and when to use which tool.

These are the folks that keep the servers spinning, repositories and build process going, plumb and connect the various automation tools into a giant contraption. The industry came around to classify the various roles as &lt;code&gt;DevOps&lt;/code&gt; short for Developers in Operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is a short compendium of tools used by DevOps today (early 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
