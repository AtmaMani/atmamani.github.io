    " 1. Create a group called 'hands_on'. If you are sharing an Enterprise / AGO then prefix the group with your initials so there is no conflict.\n",
    " 2. Use the datasets downloaded in the `/datasets/` directory (or any data that you wish) to publish at least 3 layers to your Enterprise. \n",
    " 3. Compose a web map by adding these layers as operational layers. \n",
    " 4. Use 'dark gray canvas' for basemap.\n",
    " 5. Share the web map and all the web layers to group\n",
    " 6. Display the web map in map widget\n",
    " 6. Open the web map from some other client - portal map app, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Desktop, smart phone apps"

    "### Hint\n",
    " - Use the `web_map_simple.json` file as a template for web map json. Read this json into a Python dictionary and modify it in-memory\n",
    " - Refer to the sample [https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/publishing-web-maps-and-web-scenes/](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/publishing-web-maps-and-web-scenes/) for some ideas\n",
    " - Refer to the [Web Map spec](https://developers.arcgis.com/web-map-specification/) if you want to customize the web map beyond the simple JSON found in the helper file.\n",
    " - As an alternate, publish the web map using a different client or authoring environment and access it using the API. Inspect that web map json to get some ideas"
